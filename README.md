# SE-Assignment-5
Installation and Navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
 Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of the installation and navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Installation of VS Code:
   - Describe the steps to download and install Visual Studio Code on Windows 11 operating system. Include any prerequisites that might be needed.

# Prerequisites
Windows 11 Operating System: Ensured that Windows 11 is installed and properly configured on your computer.
Internet Connection: An active internet connection is required to download the VS Code installer.
Step-by-Step Installation Guide
1. Visit the Official VS Code Website: Opened a web browser and went to the Visual Studio Code download page.
2. Download the Installer: On the download page, click on the "Windows" icon to download the installer for Windows. The download should begin automatically. The installer file is typically named something like VSCodeUserSetup-x64-<version>.exe.
3. Run the Installer: Once the download is complete, I locate the downloaded file (usually in the Downloads folder) and double-click on it to run the installer.
If prompted by the User Account Control (UAC), click "Yes" to allow the installer to make changes to your device.
4. Installer Setup: The Visual Studio Code Setup Wizard will open. Click "Next" to proceed.
Review the license agreement, then click "I accept the agreement" and click "Next".
Choose the destination folder where you want to install VS Code. The default location is usually fine. Click "Next".
5. Select Additional Tasks: I will be prompted to select additional tasks. It's recommended to check the following options:
- Create a desktop icon
Add "Open with Code" action to Windows Explorer file context menu

Register Code as an editor for supported file types
Add to PATH (required)
These options will make it easier to open files and folders with VS Code directly from Windows Explorer and ensure that VS Code is accessible from the command line.

6. Install: Clicked "Next" after selecting the additional tasks. Then click "Install" to begin the installation process.
The installation process will take a few minutes. Once it's complete, click "Finish" to exit the Setup Wizard.
